Description:
-------------
This Python script allows you to redefine the "path" and "db_name" in your JSON formatted .lpl files.
It creates a backup of the original file before making any changes.

"path" (Rom Path) is edited by only changing the folder path, it does not change the filename or file extension.

"db_name" will use the same name as the selected ".lpl" file.


Usage:
-------------
1. Select the ".lpl" playlist file you want to edit.
2. Browse or enter the new/current rom path.

Example:
 - Playlist File: `C:/retroarch/playlists/playlist.lpl`
 - Rom Path: `C:/roms/system/`
